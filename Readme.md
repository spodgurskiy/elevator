**The elevator control system**

We are going to design an evelator control system.
The elevator has the basic functions such as moving up and down, open and close doors, and pick up passengers.

The elevator is supposed to be used in a building having floors numbered from 1 to X, where the first floor is the lobby. 
There are car(Lift) call buttons in the car corresponding to each floor. 
When the car stops at a floor, the doors are opened and the car lantern indicating the current direction the car is 
going is illuminated so that the passengers can get to know the current moving direction of the car.

# UseCase 1
User can click on a hall button and the car will arrive and pick up the user.

# UserCase 2
User can select the floor using the call buttons in the car.
